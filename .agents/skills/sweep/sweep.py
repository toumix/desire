"""Sweep open PRs and issues for USER signal the pipeline has not acted on:
bodies and threads where USER spoke last, APPROVE_EMOJI reacts from USER, the
issues closed inside the window, MEMORY_REPO's open-PR count and the state of
each AGENT-owned `TODO.md`. A finding is marked 👀 when the pipeline has reacted
to say it received it. config.env is the ground truth for USER, the repos
and the emoji; AGENTS.md's rules say what to do with a finding.

Usage: sweep.py [--since <ISO8601 UTC, e.g. 2026-08-18T00:00:00Z>] <owner/repo>

Exit 0 and "clean" on a clean sweep, exit 1 with one line per finding. Open
`TODO.md` boxes are printed as context and do not make the sweep dirty.
Exit 2 when the session cannot read repo-scoped GitHub at all: that is neither
clean nor a finding, and a turn that reads it as either is planning blind.
