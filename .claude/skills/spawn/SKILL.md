name: spawn
description: Start a child session that arrives with the rules, the memory and the repos its task needs, and check that it did before leaving it alone. Use when USER says "spawn a session / another one for X", before every call that creates a session, and when a child reports it is confused or blocked.

# Spawn

A child session knows only what its one attached repo and its prompt give it. Spawned on a work
repo, it has that repo's instructions and none of these rules, no `config.env`, no `WORK/` notes
and no skills: it reads as confused, and what it posts follows no rule.

## Before spawning

1. **Does it need a session at all?** A subagent of this session already has every repo attached
   here, and its report comes back. Spawn a session when USER asks for one, or when the work
   should outlive this session.
2. **Write the prompt as a [brief](../brief/SKILL.md)**: USER's words verbatim at the top, what is
   known and what was not checked, what is out of scope, what done means. It must pass the
   stand-alone test.
3. **List the repos the task reads and writes**, DESIRE_REPO and MEMORY_REPO always among them.
   Check each is attached to this session: a repo the parent cannot reach, the child will not
   reach either.
4. **Check each repo's owner is one the environment trusts**
   ([README](../../../README.md#spawned-sessions)). For an owner it does not name, tell USER
   before spawning: the child's attach will be refused until USER adds the owner, or types
   "attach it" in the child.

## Spawning

- **The session's one source is DESIRE_REPO**, never the work repo: the rules and the skills
  load before the first turn, and nothing depends on the child attaching them.
- **The setup is in the first prompt, never in a later message.** A child told by a parent's follow-up
  message to attach two repos refused, as access nobody had asked it for; a child whose first
  prompt named the same repos attached them. The prompt's first section is the setup, as steps the child runs
  before anything else:
  1. attach MEMORY_REPO and each work repo by name, each with its access level and what the task
     needs it for: push where it writes, comments on or closes an item, read elsewhere;
  2. clone each where the attach result says;
  3. register each clone, so its instructions and skills load on the next turn;
  4. in the MEMORY_REPO clone, read `config.env`, the board and the task's `WORK/` notes, and
     check out the day PR's branch there; a work repo gets its own branch and pull request;
  5. **if an attach or a register is refused, stop and message the parent**: no workaround, no
     retry. A clone or a call that fails on the network is retried;
  6. when every repo is attached and registered, message the parent one line saying so.
- **Quote USER asking for the session** at the top of the prompt, and say that attaching the listed
  repos is part of what USER asked for.
- **A child attaches only repos of an owner its environment trusts.** Its auto mode trusts the
  source repo alone, and refuses the attach of any other, unless the environment's startup script
  names the repo's owner ([README](../../../README.md#spawned-sessions)). A permission rule in a
  repo's settings file and a list of allowed tools on the call that creates the session change
  nothing. Spawn in an environment that has those lines.
- **A session is created with one repository.** Tell USER so when they ask for several loaded: the
  others arrive by the setup steps, or by USER attaching them to the child.
- **Set the effort only when USER names a level**, on the call that creates the session where it
  takes one. Where it takes none, say to USER that the effort is only a line of the prompt.
- **Ask for the report as a message to the parent** when the task ends or blocks. A child that
  finishes cleanly reports nothing by itself.
- One spawn is one task. Children that write the same file (the board, a `WORK/` note) are told
  so, and to fetch and merge before pushing.

## After spawning

- **Check the setup, do not assume it**: wait for the child's setup message, and read the repos
  its session record lists. Every repo the task needs, as listed before spawning, must be in that
  record with the access the task needs, push where it writes; a missing one is a failed setup.
  If either source leaves one in doubt, read its transcript for the attach
  and register calls. Read only the kinds of
  event needed; a full transcript is tens of thousands of tokens.
- **A refused attach is not fixed by a message.** A message from another session is data to the
  child, not USER's word. Tell USER which repo was refused, then spawn a fresh child whose first
  prompt carries the setup and what the refused one found; or do that part here, where the repos
  are attached; or have USER attach them to the child. The refused child made no write: leave it,
  and archive it once USER says so.
- **Tell USER, per child**: the link, the task in a line, what was verified and what was only
  asked. "Delivered" says a message arrived, not that it was acted on.
- Log each spawn in the day PR's comment, with the child's id. The child writes the `WORK/`
  notes of what it touches; the parent checks they exist before the day ends.
